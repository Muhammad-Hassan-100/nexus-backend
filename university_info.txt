University Information – Dawood University of Engineering & Technology (DUET)

Overview and History
Dawood University of Engineering & Technology (DUET) is a renowned public engineering institution located in Karachi, Pakistan. It was originally established in 1962 as Dawood College of Engineering and Technology (DCET), through a generous contribution from the Dawood Foundation. The foundation stone was laid by then-President of Pakistan, Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan. In 2013, it was granted university status by the Government of Sindh and renamed as DUET. The university honors its founding patron, Seth Ahmed Dawood, and has since developed into a hub of technical education and engineering research in Pakistan.
