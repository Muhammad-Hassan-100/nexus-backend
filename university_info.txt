# University Information - FUUAST

The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology (FUUAST) is a prominent public research university in Pakistan, renowned for being the first in the country to use Urdu as the primary medium of instruction. Established on November 13, 2002, through a presidential ordinance, the university was formed by merging two institutions: the Federal Urdu Arts College and the Federal Urdu Science College. These colleges were originally founded in 1949 by Maulvi Abdul Haq, affectionately known as Baba-e-Urdu, in recognition of his dedication to promoting the Urdu language in higher education.

FUUAST operates from three campuses: the Islamabad campus, which serves as the main seat of the university and is located in Kuri Model Village; the Gulshan campus in Karachi, formerly known as the Federal Urdu Science College; and the Abdul Haq campus in Karachi, formerly the Federal Urdu Arts College. The President of Pakistan acts as the university's Chancellor, while the current Vice Chancellor is Dr. Zabta Khan Shinwari.

The university offers a wide range of academic programs across several faculties, including 39 undergraduate programs, 31 master's programs, and multiple M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees. Its most recognized departments include Computer Science, Business Administration, Economics, Islamic Studies, and Urdu. FUUAST emphasizes both academic learning and research, having published over 3,000 scientific papers, especially in disciplines like Environmental Science, Biology, Engineering, and Physics (EduRank).

With an enrollment of approximately 13,500 students and a faculty of over 450 members, the university plays a key role in expanding higher education in Pakistan. Tuition fees are relatively affordable, with undergraduate programs averaging around PKR 480,000 for four years and master's programs costing about PKR 240,000 for two years. These amounts are approximate and subject to revision, so it is advisable to consult the official university resources for the most accurate figures.
